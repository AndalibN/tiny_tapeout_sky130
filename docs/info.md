## How it works

This is a design of an analog bias amplifier for a multimodal sensor system. The amplifier is used to provide a control bias in the electrochemical sensor module of the system. 

## How to test

The amplifier will be tested for nominal oprations of an op amp. It will be characterized in terms of gain and output voltage range. 

## External hardware

Additional buffers may be required to test the bias amplifier.
